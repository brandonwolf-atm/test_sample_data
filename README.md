# test_sample_data
A repo for the miniature version of input channels for the data. 


The data in the nc file is a sample of 23 megabytes of the first nc file for the first time steps of the relevant E3SM data. Currently, there are only three channels, but I can add arbitrarily (and with easy alterations to the architecture) up to N channels).
